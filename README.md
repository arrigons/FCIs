March 2024: The FCIs are now updated to February 2024!

🗃️ Description

The database contains the three sets of Financial Condition Indices (FCIs) constructed in Arrigoni, Bobasu, Venditti (2022):

▶️ EW-FCI: Equal Weights FCI (ew_fci in the database)

▶️ PCA-FCI: Principal Component Analysis FCI (pca_fci in the database)

▶️ TVP-FCI: Time-Varying Parameters FCI (tvp_fci in the database)

Indices are standardized. For each index type, aggregate measures are also available: global, advanced economies, emerging markets, euro area.
